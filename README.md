# smolu_dsmc
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo code (Pyhton) to simulate the Smoluchowski equation with fragmentation.

The codes are explained in detail in Ref. 1 and 2 (see below)

Three versions of the code are provided, both of which implement a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo scheme to solve the Smoluchowski equation with fragmentation.

smoluchowski_dsmc_frag.py mplements the classical Smoluchowski coagulation equation, by also taking into account the possibility of fragmentation (see Ref. 1).

smoluchowski_dsmc_frag_entanglement.py is a modified version of smoluchowski_dsmc_frag.py, in which a multiplicative term is added to the annealing rate in order to take into account the steric effect of entanglements (see Ref. 1).

smoluchowski_dsmc_rings.py simulates a modified version of the Smoluchowski equation, in the absence of fragmentation (irreversible coagulation), but taking into account the possibility of loop formation (see Ref. 2).
